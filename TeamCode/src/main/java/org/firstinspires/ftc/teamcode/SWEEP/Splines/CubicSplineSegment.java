/**
 * CubicSplineSegment represents a single segment of a cubic spline path, defined by cubic polynomials for x, y, and rotation (angle) as functions of time along the segment.
 * Each segment is constructed using Catmull-Rom interpolation based on 4 control points (the previous waypoint, the start waypoint, the end waypoint, and the next waypoint)
 * to ensure smooth transitions between segments.
 * The segment also calculates its duration based on the distance between the start and end points and the desired speed defined in the end waypoint,
 * allowing for time-based evaluation of the spline.
 * The compute() method allows for evaluating the position and rotation at any given absolute time along the segment, making it compatible with path following
 * algorithms that operate in real time and need to know the target position and orientation at any given time.
 * This class is designed to be used as part of a larger path following system, where multiple CubicSplineSegments are chained together to form a complete path.
 * The class also includes an alternate constructor for creating "hold" segments, which keep the robot at a fixed position and orientation for a specified duration,
 * allowing for easy implementation of wait times at waypoints without needing special handling in the path following logic.
