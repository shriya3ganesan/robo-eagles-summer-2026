 * Don't have a super solid plan for this yet, but it needs to be involved with the PathPlanning class to add to an action cue alongside a spline movement

 * The actions contained within this class are robot specific, but lets try to make it easy to change and reuse for future seasons! if someone has a better idea, LMK! - Tobin
